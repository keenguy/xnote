A homemade markdown studio, used for personal note taking and management.

## Why another markdown editor
I've tried lots of alternatives: vnote, yu writer, hackmd, VSCode, MacDown, Quiver, Moeditor, etc.
None is perfect for me. Features I want:
* open source and hackable, customizable markdown plugin (markdown-it)
* line-sync with previewn in another window, similar as TexStudio (only sync when clicked, realtime line-sync is costly and unnecessary)
* files/project management, easy to navigate between files (both in editor and preview windows)
* convenient to export (pdf, blog site)

## Todo:
- [ ] export to blog site
- [ ] file navigation in editorWindow
- [ ] editable url 
- [ ] fix title of viewerWindow
- [ ] menu
- [ ] make tabs draggable
